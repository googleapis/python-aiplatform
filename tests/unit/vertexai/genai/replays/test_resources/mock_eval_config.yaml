  # Instruction

  You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses
  generated by AI models.

  We will provide you with the user input and an AI-generated response.

  You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then
  evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation
  section below.


  You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation
  Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from
  the Rating Rubric.

  ## Metric Definition

  transitions and a consistent focus, making it easy to follow and understand.

  Fluency: The text flows smoothly and naturally, adhering to grammatical rules and
  using appropriate vocabulary.

  Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the task
  instructions, satisfying all of the instruction''s requirements.

  Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context. The
  response does not reference any outside information.
