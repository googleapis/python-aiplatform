                The Google Cloud Storage location of the directory where the
                output is to be written to. In the given directory a new
                directory is created. Its name is
                ``prediction-<model-display-name>-<job-create-time>``, where
                timestamp is in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ISO-8601 format.
                Inside of it files ``predictions_0001.<extension>``,
                ``predictions_0002.<extension>``, ...,
                ``predictions_N.<extension>`` are created where
                ``<extension>`` depends on chosen ``predictions_format``,
                and N may equal 0001 and depends on the total number of
                successfully predicted instances. If the Model has both
                ``instance`` and ``prediction`` schemata defined then each such
                file contains predictions as per the ``predictions_format``.
                If prediction for any instance failed (partially or
                completely), then an additional ``errors_0001.<extension>``,
                ``errors_0002.<extension>``,..., ``errors_N.<extension>``
                files are created (N depends on total number of failed
                predictions). These files contain the failed instances, as
                per their schema, followed by an additional ``error`` field
                which as value has ```google.rpc.Status`` <Status>`__
                containing only ``code`` and ``message`` fields.

                The BigQuery project location where the output is to be
                written to. In the given project a new dataset is created
                with name
                ``prediction_<model-display-name>_<job-create-time>`` where
                is made BigQuery-dataset-name compatible (for example, most
                special characters become underscores), and timestamp is in
                YYYY_MM_DDThh_mm_ss_sssZ "based on ISO-8601" format. In the
                dataset two tables will be created, ``predictions``, and
                ``errors``. If the Model has both ``instance`` and ``prediction``
                schemata defined then the tables have columns as follows:
                The ``predictions`` table contains instances for which the
                prediction succeeded, it has columns as per a concatenation
                of the Model's instance and prediction schemata. The
                ``errors`` table contains rows for which the prediction has
                failed, it has instance columns, as per the instance schema,
                followed by a single "errors" column, which as values has
                ```google.rpc.Status`` <Status>`__ represented as a STRUCT,
                and containing only ``code`` and ``message``.
            model_parameters (Optional[Dict]):
                The parameters that govern the predictions. The schema of
                the parameters may be specified via the Model's `parameters_schema_uri`.
            machine_type (Optional[str]):
                The type of machine for running batch prediction on
                dedicated resources. Not specifying machine type will result in
                batch prediction job being run with automatic resources.
            accelerator_type (Optional[str]):
                The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached
                to the machine as per `accelerator_count`. Only used if
                `machine_type` is set.
            accelerator_count (Optional[int]):
                The number of accelerators to attach to the
                `machine_type`. Only used if `machine_type` is set.
            starting_replica_count (Optional[int]):
                The number of machine replicas used at the start of the batch
                operation. If not set, AI Platform decides starting number, not
                greater than `max_replica_count`. Only used if `machine_type` is
                set.
            max_replica_count (Optional[int]):
                The maximum number of machine replicas the batch operation may
                be scaled to. Only used if `machine_type` is set.
                Default is 10.
            generate_explanation (bool):
                Optional. Generate explanation along with the batch prediction
                results. This will cause the batch prediction output to include
                explanations based on the `prediction_format`:
                    - `bigquery`: output includes a column named `explanation`. The value
                        is a struct that conforms to the [aiplatform.gapic.Explanation] object.
                    - `jsonl`: The JSON objects on each line include an additional entry
                        keyed `explanation`. The value of the entry is a JSON object that
                        conforms to the [aiplatform.gapic.Explanation] object.
                    - `csv`: Generating explanations for CSV format is not supported.
            explanation_metadata (aiplatform.explain.ExplanationMetadata):
                Optional. Explanation metadata configuration for this BatchPredictionJob.
                Can be specified only if `generate_explanation` is set to `True`.

                This value overrides the value of `Model.explanation_metadata`.
                All fields of `explanation_metadata` are optional in the request. If
                a field of the `explanation_metadata` object is not populated, the
                corresponding field of the `Model.explanation_metadata` object is inherited.
                For more details, see `Ref docs <http://tinyurl.com/1igh60kt>`
            explanation_parameters (aiplatform.explain.ExplanationParameters):
                Optional. Parameters to configure explaining for Model's predictions.
                Can be specified only if `generate_explanation` is set to `True`.

                This value overrides the value of `Model.explanation_parameters`.
                All fields of `explanation_parameters` are optional in the request. If
                a field of the `explanation_parameters` object is not populated, the
                corresponding field of the `Model.explanation_parameters` object is inherited.
                For more details, see `Ref docs <http://tinyurl.com/1an4zake>`
            labels (Optional[dict]):
                The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
                BatchPredictionJobs. Label keys and values can be no longer than
                64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase
                letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes.
                International characters are allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf
                for more information and examples of labels.
            credentials (Optional[auth_credentials.Credentials]):
                Custom credentials to use to create this batch prediction
                job. Overrides credentials set in aiplatform.init.
            encryption_spec_key_name (Optional[str]):
                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
                managed encryption key used to protect the job. Has the
                form:
                ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.

                If this is set, then all
                resources created by the BatchPredictionJob will
                be encrypted with the provided encryption key.

                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
            sync (bool):
                Whether to execute this method synchronously. If False, this method
                will be executed in concurrent Future and any downstream object will
                be immediately returned and synced when the Future has completed.

        Returns:
            (jobs.BatchPredictionJob):
                Instantiated representation of the created batch prediction job.
