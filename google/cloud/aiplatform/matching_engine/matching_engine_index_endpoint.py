                value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment
                succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas
                is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the
                deployed model increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may

                These logs are like standard server access logs,
                containing information like timestamp and
                latency for each MatchRequest.
                Note that Stackdriver logs may incur a cost,
                especially if the deployed index receives a high
                queries per second rate (QPS). Estimate your
                costs before enabling this option.
            deployed_index_auth_config (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.DeployedIndexAuthConfig):

                Optional. A list of reserved ip ranges under
                the VPC network that can be used for this
                DeployedIndex.
                If set, we will deploy the index within the
                provided ip ranges. Otherwise, the index might
                be deployed to any ip ranges under the provided
                VPC network.

                'default' deployment group.

                Creating ``deployment_groups`` with ``reserved_ip_ranges``
                is a recommended practice when the peered network has
                multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from
                predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration.
                Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be
                used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the
                deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a,
                b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed.

                that are allowed to access. A JWT containing any of these
                audiences will be accepted.
            auth_config_allowed_issuers (Sequence[str]):
                Optional. A list of allowed JWT issuers. Each entry must be a valid

        Args:
            deployed_index_id (str):
                Required. The ID of the DeployedIndex to match the queries against.
            queries (List[List[float]]):
                Required. A list of queries. Each query is a list of floats, representing a single embedding.
            num_neighbors (int):
                Required. The number of nearest neighbors to be retrieved from database for
                each query.
            filter (List[Namespace]):
                Optional. A list of Namespaces for filtering the matching results.
                For example, [Namespace("color", ["red"], []), Namespace("shape", [], ["squared"])] will match datapoints
                that satisfy "red color" but not include datapoints with "squared shape".
                Please refer to https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/filtering#json for more detail.
            per_crowding_attribute_num_neighbors (int):
                Optional. Crowding is a constraint on a neighbor list produced by nearest neighbor
                search requiring that no more than some value k' of the k neighbors
                returned have the same value of crowding_attribute.
                It's used for improving result diversity.
                This field is the maximum number of matches with the same crowding tag.
            approx_num_neighbors (int):
                The number of neighbors to find via approximate search before exact reordering is performed.
                If not set, the default value from scam config is used; if set, this value must be > 0.

        Returns:
            List[List[MatchNeighbor]] - A list of nearest neighbors for each query.
