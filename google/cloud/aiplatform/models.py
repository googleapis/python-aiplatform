                failed, it has instance columns, as per the instance schema,
                followed by a single "errors" column, which as values has

                Optional. The type of machine for running batch prediction on
                dedicated resources. Not specifying machine type will result in
                batch prediction job being run with automatic resources.
            accelerator_type: Optional[str] = None
                Optional. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached

            accelerator_count: Optional[int] = None
                Optional. The number of accelerators to attach to the

            starting_replica_count: Optional[int] = None
                The number of machine replicas used at the start of the batch
                operation. If not set, AI Platform decides starting number, not
                greater than `max_replica_count`. Only used if `machine_type` is
                set.
            max_replica_count: Optional[int] = None
                The maximum number of machine replicas the batch operation may
