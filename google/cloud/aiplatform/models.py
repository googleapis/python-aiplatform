                The environment variables that are to be present in the container.
                Should be a dictionary where keys are environment variable names
                and values are environment variable values for those names.
            serving_container_ports: Optional[Sequence[int]]=None,
                Declaration of ports that are exposed by the container. This field is
                primarily informational, it gives AI Platform information about the
                network connections the container uses. Listing or not a port here has
                no impact on whether the port is actually exposed, any port listening on
                the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from
