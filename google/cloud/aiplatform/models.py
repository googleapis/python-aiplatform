            dedicated_endpoint_enabled (bool):
                Optional. If enabled, a dedicated dns will be created and your
                traffic will be fully isolated from other customers' traffic and
                latency will be reduced.
            inference_timeout (int):
                Optional. It defines the prediction timeout, in seconds, for online predictions using cloud-based endpoints. This applies to either PSC endpoints, when private_service_connect_config is set, or dedicated endpoints, when dedicated_endpoint_enabled is true.

        Args:
            model (aiplatform.Model):
                Required. Model to be deployed.
            deployed_model_display_name (str):
                Optional. The display name of the DeployedModel. If not provided
                upon creation, the Model's display_name is used.
            traffic_percentage (int):
                Optional. Desired traffic to newly deployed model. Defaults to
                0 if there are pre-existing deployed models. Defaults to 100 if
                there are no pre-existing deployed models. Negative values should
                not be provided. Traffic of previously deployed models at the endpoint
                will be scaled down to accommodate new deployed model's traffic.
                Should not be provided if traffic_split is provided.
            traffic_split (Dict[str, int]):
                Optional. A map from a DeployedModel's ID to the percentage of
                this Endpoint's traffic that should be forwarded to that DeployedModel.
                If a DeployedModel's ID is not listed in this map, then it receives
                no traffic. The traffic percentage values must add up to 100, or
                map must be empty if the Endpoint is to not accept any traffic at
                the moment. Key for model being deployed is "0". Should not be
                provided if traffic_percentage is provided.
            machine_type (str):

                Optional. The minimum number of machine replicas this deployed
                model will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases,
                it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic
                decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
            max_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The maximum number of replicas this deployed model may
                be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If requested
                value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment
                succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas
                is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the

                handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value
                is not provided, the larger value of min_replica_count or 1 will
                be used. If value provided is smaller than min_replica_count, it

                The service account that the DeployedModel's container runs as. Specify the
                email address of the service account. If this service account is not
                specified, the container runs as a service account that doesn't have access
                to the resource project.
                Users deploying the Model must have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`

                written to Cloud Logging. Defaults to False.
            deployment_resource_pool (DeploymentResourcePool):
                Resource pool where the model will be deployed. All models that
                are deployed to the same DeploymentResourcePool will be hosted in

        Args:
            model (aiplatform.Model):
                Required. Model to be deployed.
            deployed_model_display_name (str):
                Optional. The display name of the DeployedModel. If not provided
                upon creation, the Model's display_name is used.
            machine_type (str):
                Optional. The type of machine. Not specifying machine type will
                result in model to be deployed with automatic resources.
            min_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The minimum number of machine replicas this deployed
                model will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases,
                it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic
                decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
            max_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The maximum number of replicas this deployed model may
                be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If requested
                value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment
                succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas
                is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the
                deployed model increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may
                handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value
                is not provided, the larger value of min_replica_count or 1 will
                be used. If value provided is smaller than min_replica_count, it
                will automatically be increased to be min_replica_count.
            accelerator_type (str):
                Optional. Hardware accelerator type. Must also set accelerator_count if used.
                One of ACCELERATOR_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, NVIDIA_TESLA_K80, NVIDIA_TESLA_P100,
                NVIDIA_TESLA_V100, NVIDIA_TESLA_P4, NVIDIA_TESLA_T4
            accelerator_count (int):
                Optional. The number of accelerators to attach to a worker replica.
            tpu_topology (str):
                Optional. The TPU topology to use for the DeployedModel.
                Required for CloudTPU multihost deployments.
            service_account (str):
                The service account that the DeployedModel's container runs as. Specify the
                email address of the service account. If this service account is not
                specified, the container runs as a service account that doesn't have access
                to the resource project.
                Users deploying the Model must have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`
                permission on this service account.
            explanation_metadata (aiplatform.explain.ExplanationMetadata):
                Optional. Metadata describing the Model's input and output for explanation.
                `explanation_metadata` is optional while `explanation_parameters` must be
                specified when used.
                For more details, see `Ref docs <http://tinyurl.com/1igh60kt>`
            explanation_parameters (aiplatform.explain.ExplanationParameters):
                Optional. Parameters to configure explaining for Model's predictions.
                For more details, see `Ref docs <http://tinyurl.com/1an4zake>`
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]):
                Optional. Strings which should be sent along with the request as
                metadata.
            sync (bool):

                will be executed in concurrent Future and any downstream object will
                be immediately returned and synced when the Future has completed.
            traffic_percentage (int):
                Optional. Desired traffic to newly deployed model.
                Defaults to 0 if there are pre-existing deployed models.
                Defaults to 100 if there are no pre-existing deployed models.
                Defaults to 100 for PSA based private endpoint.
                Negative values should not be provided. Traffic of previously
                deployed models at the endpoint will be scaled down to
                accommodate new deployed model's traffic.
                Should not be provided if traffic_split is provided.
            traffic_split (Dict[str, int]):
                Optional. Only supported by PSC base private endpoint.
                A map from a DeployedModel's ID to the percentage of
                this Endpoint's traffic that should be forwarded to that DeployedModel.
                If a DeployedModel's ID is not listed in this map, then it receives
                no traffic. The traffic percentage values must add up to 100, or
                map must be empty if the Endpoint is to not accept any traffic at
                the moment. Key for model being deployed is "0". Should not be
                provided if traffic_percentage is provided.
            reservation_affinity_type (str):
                Optional. The type of reservation affinity.
                One of NO_RESERVATION, ANY_RESERVATION, SPECIFIC_RESERVATION,
                SPECIFIC_THEN_ANY_RESERVATION, SPECIFIC_THEN_NO_RESERVATION
            reservation_affinity_key (str):
                Optional. Corresponds to the label key of a reservation resource.
                To target a SPECIFIC_RESERVATION by name, use `compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name` as the key
                and specify the name of your reservation as its value.
            reservation_affinity_values (List[str]):
                Optional. Corresponds to the label values of a reservation resource.
                This must be the full resource name of the reservation.
                Format: 'projects/{project_id_or_number}/zones/{zone}/reservations/{reservation_name}'
            spot (bool):
                Optional. Whether to schedule the deployment workload on spot VMs.
            system_labels (Dict[str, str]):
                Optional. System labels to apply to Model Garden deployments.
                System labels are managed by Google for internal use only.
            required_replica_count (int):
                Optional. Number of required available replicas for the
                deployment to succeed. This field is only needed when partial
                model deployment/mutation is desired, with a value greater than
                or equal to 1 and fewer than or equal to min_replica_count. If
                set, the model deploy/mutate operation will succeed once
                available_replica_count reaches required_replica_count, and the
                rest of the replicas will be retried.

                expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not.
            serving_container_args: Optional[Sequence[str]]=None,
                The arguments to the command. The Docker image's CMD is used if this is
                not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the
                container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference
                in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be
                escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will
                never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not.
            serving_container_environment_variables: Optional[Dict[str, str]]=None,
                The environment variables that are to be present in the container.

                and values are environment variable values for those names.
            serving_container_ports: Optional[Sequence[int]]=None,
                Declaration of ports that are exposed by the container. This field is
                primarily informational, it gives Vertex AI information about the
                network connections the container uses. Listing or not a port here has
                no impact on whether the port is actually exposed, any port listening on
                the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from
                the network.
            serving_container_grpc_ports: Optional[Sequence[int]]=None,
                Declaration of ports that are exposed by the container. Vertex AI sends gRPC
                prediction requests that it receives to the first port on this list. Vertex
                AI also sends liveness and health checks to this port.
                If you do not specify this field, gRPC requests to the container will be
                disabled.
                Vertex AI does not use ports other than the first one listed. This field
                corresponds to the `ports` field of the Kubernetes Containers v1 core API.

        Args:
            endpoint (Union[Endpoint, PrivateEndpoint]):
                Optional. Public or private Endpoint to deploy model to. If not specified,
                endpoint display name will be model display name+'_endpoint'.
            deployed_model_display_name (str):
                Optional. The display name of the DeployedModel. If not provided
                upon creation, the Model's display_name is used.
            traffic_percentage (int):
                Optional. Desired traffic to newly deployed model. Defaults to
                0 if there are pre-existing deployed models. Defaults to 100 if
                there are no pre-existing deployed models. Negative values should
                not be provided. Traffic of previously deployed models at the endpoint
                will be scaled down to accommodate new deployed model's traffic.
                Should not be provided if traffic_split is provided.
            traffic_split (Dict[str, int]):
                Optional. A map from a DeployedModel's ID to the percentage of
                this Endpoint's traffic that should be forwarded to that DeployedModel.
                If a DeployedModel's ID is not listed in this map, then it receives
                no traffic. The traffic percentage values must add up to 100, or
                map must be empty if the Endpoint is to not accept any traffic at
                the moment. Key for model being deployed is "0". Should not be
                provided if traffic_percentage is provided.
            machine_type (str):
                Optional. The type of machine. Not specifying machine type will
                result in model to be deployed with automatic resources.
            min_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The minimum number of machine replicas this deployed
                model will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases,
                it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic
                decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
            max_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The maximum number of replicas this deployed model may
                be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If requested
                value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment
                succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas
                is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the
                deployed model increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may
                handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value
                is not provided, the smaller value of min_replica_count or 1 will
                be used.
            accelerator_type (str):
                Optional. Hardware accelerator type. Must also set accelerator_count if used.
                One of ACCELERATOR_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED, NVIDIA_TESLA_K80, NVIDIA_TESLA_P100,
                NVIDIA_TESLA_V100, NVIDIA_TESLA_P4, NVIDIA_TESLA_T4

                Optional. The number of accelerators to attach to a worker replica.
            tpu_topology (str):
                Optional. The TPU topology to use for the DeployedModel.
                Requireid for CloudTPU multihost deployments.
            service_account (str):
                The service account that the DeployedModel's container runs as. Specify the
                email address of the service account. If this service account is not
                specified, the container runs as a service account that doesn't have access
                to the resource project.
                Users deploying the Model must have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`
                permission on this service account.
            explanation_metadata (aiplatform.explain.ExplanationMetadata):
                Optional. Metadata describing the Model's input and output for explanation.
                `explanation_metadata` is optional while `explanation_parameters` must be
                specified when used.

                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
                managed encryption key used to protect the model. Has the
                form:
                ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.

                If set, this Endpoint and all sub-resources of this Endpoint will be secured by this key.

                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
            network (str):

                Private services access must already be configured for the network.
                If set or aiplatform.init(network=...) has been set, a PrivateEndpoint will be created.
                If left unspecified, an Endpoint will be created. Read more about PrivateEndpoints
                [in the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/using-private-endpoints).

                Whether to enable endpoint access logging. Defaults to False.
            disable_container_logging (bool):
                If True, container logs from the deployed model will not be
                written to Cloud Logging. Defaults to False.
            private_service_connect_config (PrivateEndpoint.PrivateServiceConnectConfig):
                If true, the endpoint can be accessible via [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect).

        Args:
            endpoint (Union[Endpoint, PrivateEndpoint]):
                Optional. Public or private Endpoint to deploy model to. If not specified,
                endpoint display name will be model display name+'_endpoint'.
            deployed_model_display_name (str):
                Optional. The display name of the DeployedModel. If not provided
                upon creation, the Model's display_name is used.
            traffic_percentage (int):
                Optional. Desired traffic to newly deployed model. Defaults to
                0 if there are pre-existing deployed models. Defaults to 100 if
                there are no pre-existing deployed models. Negative values should
                not be provided. Traffic of previously deployed models at the endpoint
                will be scaled down to accommodate new deployed model's traffic.
                Should not be provided if traffic_split is provided.
            traffic_split (Dict[str, int]):
                Optional. A map from a DeployedModel's ID to the percentage of

                no traffic. The traffic percentage values must add up to 100, or
                map must be empty if the Endpoint is to not accept any traffic at
                the moment. Key for model being deployed is "0". Should not be

                Optional. The minimum number of machine replicas this deployed
                model will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases,
                it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic
                decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
            max_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The maximum number of replicas this deployed model may
                be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If requested
                value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment
                succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas
                is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the
                deployed model increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may
                handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value
                is not provided, the smaller value of min_replica_count or 1 will
                be used.

            service_account (str):
                The service account that the DeployedModel's container runs as. Specify the
                email address of the service account. If this service account is not
                specified, the container runs as a service account that doesn't have access
                to the resource project.
                Users deploying the Model must have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`
                permission on this service account.

                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.

                If set, this Model and all sub-resources of this Model will be secured by this key.

                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init
            network (str):
                Optional. The full name of the Compute Engine network to which
                the Endpoint, if created, will be peered to. E.g. "projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC".

                model deployment/mutation is desired, with a value greater than
                or equal to 1 and fewer than or equal to min_replica_count. If
                set, the model deploy/mutate operation will succeed once

                The number of machine replicas used at the start of the batch
                operation. If not set, Vertex AI decides starting number, not
                greater than `max_replica_count`. Only used if `machine_type` is
                set.
            max_replica_count: Optional[int] = None

            generate_explanation (bool):
                Optional. Generate explanation along with the batch prediction
                results. This will cause the batch prediction output to include
                explanations based on the `prediction_format`:
                    - `bigquery`: output includes a column named `explanation`. The value
                        is a struct that conforms to the [aiplatform.gapic.Explanation] object.
                    - `jsonl`: The JSON objects on each line include an additional entry
                        keyed `explanation`. The value of the entry is a JSON object that
                        conforms to the [aiplatform.gapic.Explanation] object.
                    - `csv`: Generating explanations for CSV format is not supported.
            explanation_metadata (aiplatform.explain.ExplanationMetadata):
                Optional. Explanation metadata configuration for this BatchPredictionJob.
                Can be specified only if `generate_explanation` is set to `True`.

                This value overrides the value of `Model.explanation_metadata`.
                All fields of `explanation_metadata` are optional in the request. If
                a field of the `explanation_metadata` object is not populated, the
                corresponding field of the `Model.explanation_metadata` object is inherited.

            explanation_parameters (aiplatform.explain.ExplanationParameters):
                Optional. Parameters to configure explaining for Model's predictions.
                Can be specified only if `generate_explanation` is set to `True`.

                This value overrides the value of `Model.explanation_parameters`.
                All fields of `explanation_parameters` are optional in the request. If
                a field of the `explanation_parameters` object is not populated, the
                corresponding field of the `Model.explanation_parameters` object is inherited.

                64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase
                letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes.
                International characters are allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf
                for more information and examples of labels.
            credentials: Optional[auth_credentials.Credentials] = None
                Optional. Custom credentials to use to create this batch prediction
                job. Overrides credentials set in aiplatform.init.
            encryption_spec_key_name (Optional[str]):
                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
                managed encryption key used to protect the model. Has the
                form:
                ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.

                If set, this Model and all sub-resources of this Model will be secured by this key.

                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
            create_request_timeout (float):

                Optional. The number of the records (e.g. instances) of the operation given in each batch
                to a machine replica. Machine type, and size of a single record should be considered
                when setting this parameter, higher value speeds up the batch operation's execution,
                but too high value will result in a whole batch not fitting in a machine's memory,
                and the whole operation will fail.
                The default value is 64.
            service_account (str):
                Optional. Specifies the service account for workload run-as account.
                Users submitting jobs must have act-as permission on this run-as account.

                Specifies the service account for workload run-as account for this Model Evaluation PipelineJob.
                Users submitting jobs must have act-as permission on this run-as account. The service account running
                this Model Evaluation job needs the following permissions: Dataflow Worker, Storage Admin,
                Vertex AI Administrator, and Vertex AI Service Agent.
            generate_feature_attributions (boolean):
                Optional. Whether the model evaluation job should generate feature attributions. Defaults to False if not specified.

                should be peered. For example, projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC.
                Private services access must already be configured for the network.
                If left unspecified, the job is not peered with any network.
            encryption_spec_key_name (str):
                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer managed encryption key used to protect the job. Has the
                form: ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``. The key needs to be in the same
                region as where the compute resource is created. If this is set, then all
                resources created by the PipelineJob for this Model Evaluation will be encrypted with the provided encryption key.

                Optional. The Vertex AI experiment name or instance to associate to the PipelineJob executing
                this model evaluation job. Metrics produced by the PipelineJob as system.Metric Artifacts
                will be associated as metrics to the provided experiment, and parameters from this PipelineJob
                will be associated as parameters to the provided experiment.
            enable_caching (bool):
                Optional. Whether to turn on caching for the run.

                If this is not set, defaults to the compile time settings, which
                are True for all tasks by default, while users may specify
                different caching options for individual tasks.

                If this is set, the setting applies to all tasks in the pipeline.
