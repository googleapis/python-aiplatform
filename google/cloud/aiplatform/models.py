        Args:
            endpoint ("Endpoint"):
                Optional. Endpoint to deploy model to. If not specified, endpoint
                display name will be model display name+'_endpoint'.
            deployed_model_display_name (str):
                Optional. The display name of the DeployedModel. If not provided
                upon creation, the Model's display_name is used.
            traffic_percentage (int):
                Optional. Desired traffic to newly deployed model. Defaults to
                0 if there are pre-existing deployed models. Defaults to 100 if
                there are no pre-existing deployed models. Negative values should
                not be provided. Traffic of previously deployed models at the endpoint
                will be scaled down to accommodate new deployed model's traffic.
                Should not be provided if traffic_split is provided.
            traffic_split (Dict[str, int]):
                Optional. A map from a DeployedModel's ID to the percentage of
                this Endpoint's traffic that should be forwarded to that DeployedModel.
                If a DeployedModel's ID is not listed in this map, then it receives
                no traffic. The traffic percentage values must add up to 100, or
                map must be empty if the Endpoint is to not accept any traffic at
                the moment. Key for model being deployed is "0". Should not be
                provided if traffic_percentage is provided.
            machine_type (str):
                Optional. The type of machine. Not specifying machine type will
                result in model to be deployed with automatic resources.
            min_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The minimum number of machine replicas this deployed
                model will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases,
                it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic
                decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
            max_replica_count (int):
                Optional. The maximum number of replicas this deployed model may
                be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If requested
                value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment
                succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas
                is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the
                deployed model increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may
                handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value
                is not provided, the smaller value of min_replica_count or 1 will
                be used.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]):
                Optional. Strings which should be sent along with the request as
                metadata.
            sync (bool):
                Whether to execute this method synchronously. If False, this method
                will be executed in concurrent Future and any downstream object will
                be immediately returned and synced when the Future has completed.

            gcs_destination_prefix: Optional[str] = None
                The Google Cloud Storage location of the directory where the

                directory is created. Its name is

                timestamp is in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ ISO-8601 format.

                ``predictions_0002.<extension>``, ...,

                ``instance`` and ``prediction`` schemata defined then each such

                files are created (N depends on total number of failed

                per their schema, followed by an additional ``error`` field
                which as value has ```google.rpc.Status`` <Status>`__
                containing only ``code`` and ``message`` fields.

                The BigQuery project location where the output is to be

                YYYY_MM_DDThh_mm_ss_sssZ "based on ISO-8601" format. In the
                dataset two tables will be created, ``predictions``, and
                ``errors``. If the Model has both ``instance`` and ``prediction``
                schemata defined then the tables have columns as follows:
                The ``predictions`` table contains instances for which the
                prediction succeeded, it has columns as per a concatenation
                of the Model's instance and prediction schemata. The
                ``errors`` table contains rows for which the prediction has
                failed, it has instance columns, as per the instance schema,
                followed by a single "errors" column, which as values has
                ```google.rpc.Status`` <Status>`__ represented as a STRUCT,

            predictions_format: str = "jsonl"
                Required. The format in which AI Platform gives the
                predictions, must be one of "jsonl", "csv", or "bigquery".
                Default is "jsonl" when using `gcs_destination_prefix`. If a
                `bigquery_destination_prefix` is provided, this is overriden to
                "bigquery".

                Optional. The parameters that govern the predictions. The schema of

            machine_type: Optional[str] = None
                Optional. The type of machine for running batch prediction on
                dedicated resources. Not specifying machine type will result in
                batch prediction job being run with automatic resources.
            accelerator_type: Optional[str] = None
                Optional. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached
                to the machine as per `accelerator_count`. Only used if
                `machine_type` is set.
            accelerator_count: Optional[int] = None
                Optional. The number of accelerators to attach to the
                `machine_type`. Only used if `machine_type` is set.
            starting_replica_count: Optional[int] = None
                The number of machine replicas used at the start of the batch
                operation. If not set, AI Platform decides starting number, not
                greater than `max_replica_count`. Only used if `machine_type` is
                set.
            max_replica_count: Optional[int] = None
                The maximum number of machine replicas the batch operation may
                be scaled to. Only used if `machine_type` is set.
                Default is 10.
            labels: Optional[dict] = None
                Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
                BatchPredictionJobs. Label keys and values can be no longer than
                64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase
                letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes.
                International characters are allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf
