        Args:
            display_name (str):
                Required. The user-defined name of the Dataset.
                The name can be up to 128 characters long and can be consist
                of any UTF-8 characters.
            gcs_source (Union[str, Sequence[str]]):
                Google Cloud Storage URI(-s) to the
                input file(s). May contain wildcards. For more
                information on wildcards, see
                https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WildcardNames.
                examples:

            bq_source (str):
                BigQuery URI to the input table.
                example:
                    "bq://project.dataset.table_name"
            project (str):
                Project to upload this model to. Overrides project set in
                aiplatform.init.
            location (str):
                Location to upload this model to. Overrides location set in
                aiplatform.init.
            credentials (auth_credentials.Credentials):
                Custom credentials to use to upload this model. Overrides
                credentials set in aiplatform.init.
            request_metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]):
                Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
            encryption_spec_key_name (Optional[str]):
                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
                managed encryption key used to protect the dataset. Has the
                form:
                ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.

                If set, this Dataset and all sub-resources of this Dataset will be secured by this key.

                Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
            sync (bool):
                Whether to execute this method synchronously. If False, this method
                will be executed in concurrent Future and any downstream object will
                be immediately returned and synced when the Future has completed.

        Returns:
            time_series_dataset (TimeSeriesDataset):
                Instantiated representation of the managed time series dataset resource.
