class ContainerSpec:
    """Container configuration for the model.
    Args:
        image_uri (str):
            Required. URI of the Docker image to be used as the custom
            container for serving predictions. This URI must identify an image
            in Artifact Registry or Container Registry.
        command (Sequence[str]):
            Optional. Specifies the command that runs when the container
            starts. This overrides the container's `ENTRYPOINT`.
        args (Sequence[str]):
            Optional. Specifies arguments for the command that runs when the
            container starts. This overrides the container's `CMD`
        env (Sequence[google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.EnvVar]):
            Optional. List of environment variables to set in the container.
            After the container starts running, code running in the container
            can read these environment variables. Additionally, the command
            and args fields can reference these variables. Later entries in
            this list can also reference earlier entries. For example, the
            following example sets the variable ``VAR_2`` to have the value
            ``foo bar``: .. code:: json [ { "name": "VAR_1", "value": "foo" },
            { "name": "VAR_2", "value": "$(VAR_1) bar" } ] If you switch the
            order of the variables in the example, then the expansion does not
            occur. This field corresponds to the ``env`` field of the
            Kubernetes Containers `v1 core API.
        ports (Sequence[google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.Port]):
            Optional. List of ports to expose from the container. Vertex AI
            sends any prediction requests that it receives to the first port on
            this list. Vertex AI also sends `liveness and health checks.
        predict_route (str):
            Optional. HTTP path on the container to send prediction requests
            to. Vertex AI forwards requests sent using
            projects.locations.endpoints.predict to this path on the
            container's IP address and port. Vertex AI then returns the
            container's response in the API response. For example, if you set
            this field to ``/foo``, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction
            request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the
            ``/foo`` path on the port of your container specified by the first
            value of this ``ModelContainerSpec``'s ports field. If you don't
            specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you
            deploy this Model to an Endpoint
            /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict
            The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows:
            - ENDPOINT: The last segment (following ``endpoints/``)of the
              Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has
              been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your
              container code as the ```AIP_ENDPOINT_ID`` environment variable
        health_route (str):
            Optional. HTTP path on the container to send health checks to.
            Vertex AI intermittently sends GET requests to this path on the
            container's IP address and port to check that the container is
            healthy. Read more about `health checks
