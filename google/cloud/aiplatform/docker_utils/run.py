    Args:
        serving_container_image_uri (str):
            Required. The URI of the Model serving container.
        artifact_uri (str):
            Optional. The Cloud Storage path to the directory containing the Model artifact
            and any of its supporting files. The AIP_STORAGE_URI environment variable will
            be set to this uri if given; otherwise, an empty string.
        serving_container_predict_route (str):
            Optional. An HTTP path to send prediction requests to the container, and
            which must be supported by it. If not specified a default HTTP path will
            be used by Vertex AI.
        serving_container_health_route (str):
            Optional. An HTTP path to send health check requests to the container, and which
            must be supported by it. If not specified a standard HTTP path will be
            used by Vertex AI.
        serving_container_command (Sequence[str]):
            Optional. The command with which the container is run. Not executed within a
            shell. The Docker image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided.
            Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
            environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the
            input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped
            with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be
            expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not.
        serving_container_args: (Sequence[str]):
            Optional. The arguments to the command. The Docker image's CMD is used if this is
            not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the
            container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference
            in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be
            escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will
            never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not.
        serving_container_environment_variables (Dict[str, str]):
            Optional. The environment variables that are to be present in the container.
            Should be a dictionary where keys are environment variable names
            and values are environment variable values for those names.
        serving_container_ports (Sequence[int]):
            Optional. Declaration of ports that are exposed by the container. This field is
            primarily informational, it gives Vertex AI information about the
            network connections the container uses. Listing or not a port here has
            no impact on whether the port is actually exposed, any port listening on
            the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from
            the network.
        credential_path (str):
            Optional. The path to the credential key that will be mounted to the container.
            If it's unset, the environment variable, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS, will
            be used if set.
        host_port (int):
            Optional. The port on the host that the port, AIP_HTTP_PORT, inside the container
            will be exposed as. If it's unset, a random host port will be assigned.

    Returns:
        The container object running in the background.

        ValueError: If artifact_uri is not a valid GCS path, or if credential_path or the file
            pointed by the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS does not exist.
