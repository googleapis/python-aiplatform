class ReasoningEngineExecutionServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for ReasoningEngineExecutionService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the ReasoningEngineExecutionServiceRestTransport.

                    should only be used for payload formats that can't be
                    represented as JSON, such as raw binary or an HTML page.

                    This message can be used both in streaming and
                    non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the
                    response.

                    It can be used as a top-level request field, which is
                    convenient if one wants to extract parameters from
                    either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields
                    and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

                    Example:

                    ::

                        message GetResourceRequest {
                          // A unique request id.
                          string request_id = 1;

                          // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
                          google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;

                        }

                        service ResourceService {
                          rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
                            returns (google.api.HttpBody);
                          rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
                            returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

                        }

                    Example with streaming methods:

                    ::

                        service CaldavService {
                          rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                            returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
                          rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                            returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

                        }

                    Use of this type only changes how the request and
                    response bodies are handled, all other features will
                    continue to work unchanged.
