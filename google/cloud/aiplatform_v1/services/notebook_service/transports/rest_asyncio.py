class AsyncNotebookServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Asynchronous Interceptor for NotebookService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the AsyncNotebookServiceRestTransport.

            r"""Call the wait operation method over HTTP.

            Args:
                request (operations_pb2.WaitOperationRequest):
                    The request object for WaitOperation method.
                retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                    should be retried.
                timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
                metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                    sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,
                    but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                    be of type `bytes`.

            Returns:
                operations_pb2.Operation: Response from WaitOperation method.
