class TensorboardExperiment(proto.Message):
    r"""A TensorboardExperiment is a group of TensorboardRuns, that
    are typically the results of a training job run, in a
    Tensorboard.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. Name of the TensorboardExperiment. Format:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/tensorboards/{tensorboard}/experiments/{experiment}``
        display_name (str):
            User provided name of this
            TensorboardExperiment.
        description (str):
            Description of this TensorboardExperiment.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this
            TensorboardExperiment was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this
            TensorboardExperiment was last updated.
        labels (Sequence[google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.TensorboardExperiment.LabelsEntry]):
            The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
            Datasets.

            Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
            (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters,
            numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International
            characters are allowed. No more than 64 user labels can be
            associated with one Dataset (System labels are excluded).

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples
            of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with
            "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable. Following
            system labels exist for each Dataset:

            -  "aiplatform.googleapis.com/dataset_metadata_schema":

               -  output only, its value is the
                  [metadata_schema's][metadata_schema_uri] title.
        etag (str):
            Used to perform consistent read-modify-write
            updates. If not set, a blind "overwrite" update
            happens.
        source (str):
            Immutable. Source of the
            TensorboardExperiment. Example: a custom
            training job.
