class VizierServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for VizierService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the VizierServiceRestTransport.

    Vertex AI Vizier API.

    Vertex AI Vizier is a service to solve blackbox optimization
    problems, such as tuning machine learning hyperparameters and
    searching over deep learning architectures.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends JSON representations of protocol buffers over HTTP/1.1

                credentials identify the application to the service; if none
                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the
                credentials from the environment.

            credentials_file (Optional[str]): A file with credentials that can
                be loaded with :func:`google.auth.load_credentials_from_file`.
                This argument is ignored if ``channel`` is provided.

                ignored if ``channel`` is provided.

            always_use_jwt_access (Optional[bool]): Whether self signed JWT should
                be used for service account credentials.

                "https", but for testing or local servers,
