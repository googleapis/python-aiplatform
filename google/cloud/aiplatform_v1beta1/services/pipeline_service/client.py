        the TrainingPipeline. The server makes a best effort to cancel
        the pipeline, but success is not guaranteed. Clients can use
        ``PipelineService.GetTrainingPipeline``
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or
        whether the pipeline completed despite cancellation. On
        successful cancellation, the TrainingPipeline is not deleted;
        instead it becomes a pipeline with a
        ``TrainingPipeline.error``
        value with a ``google.rpc.Status.code`` of
        1, corresponding to ``Code.CANCELLED``, and
        ``TrainingPipeline.state``
        is set to ``CANCELLED``.

            request (:class:`~.pipeline_service.CancelTrainingPipelineRequest`):
                The request object. Request message for
                ``PipelineService.CancelTrainingPipeline``.
            name (:class:`str`):
                Required. The name of the TrainingPipeline to cancel.
                Format:

                ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/trainingPipelines/{training_pipeline}``
                This corresponds to the ``name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.
