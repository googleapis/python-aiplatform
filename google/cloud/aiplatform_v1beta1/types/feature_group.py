    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        big_query (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.FeatureGroup.BigQuery):
            Indicates that features for this group come from BigQuery
            Table/View. By default treats the source as a sparse time
            series source. The BigQuery source table or view must have
            at least one entity ID column and a column named
            ``feature_timestamp``.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``source``.
        name (str):
            Identifier. Name of the FeatureGroup. Format:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/featureGroups/{featureGroup}``
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this FeatureGroup
            was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this FeatureGroup
            was last updated.
        etag (str):
            Optional. Used to perform consistent
            read-modify-write updates. If not set, a blind
            "overwrite" update happens.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. The labels with user-defined
            metadata to organize your FeatureGroup.

            Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
            characters (Unicode codepoints), can only
            contain lowercase letters, numeric characters,
            underscores and dashes. International characters
            are allowed.

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information
            on and examples of labels. No more than 64 user
            labels can be associated with one
            FeatureGroup(System labels are excluded)."
            System reserved label keys are prefixed with
            "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable.
        description (str):
            Optional. Description of the FeatureGroup.
        service_agent_type (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.FeatureGroup.ServiceAgentType):
            Optional. Service agent type used during jobs under a
            FeatureGroup. By default, the Vertex AI Service Agent is
            used. When using an IAM Policy to isolate this FeatureGroup
            within a project, a separate service account should be
            provisioned by setting this field to
            ``SERVICE_AGENT_TYPE_FEATURE_GROUP``. This will generate a
            separate service account to access the BigQuery source
            table.
        service_account_email (str):
            Output only. A Service Account unique to this
            FeatureGroup. The role bigquery.dataViewer
            should be granted to this service account to
            allow Vertex AI Feature Store to access source
            data while running jobs under this FeatureGroup.

                [FeatureView][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.FeatureView] )

                Optional. If set, all feature values will be fetched from a
                single row per unique entityId including nulls. If not set,
                will collapse all rows for each unique entityId into a singe
                row with any non-null values if present, if no non-null

                rows: ``(e1, 2020-01-01T10:00:00.123Z, 10, 15)``
