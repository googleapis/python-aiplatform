class DeploymentResourcePool(proto.Message):
    r"""A description of resources that can be shared by multiple
    DeployedModels, whose underlying specification consists of a
    DedicatedResources.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Immutable. The resource name of the DeploymentResourcePool.
            Format:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/deploymentResourcePools/{deployment_resource_pool}``
        dedicated_resources (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.DedicatedResources):
            Required. The underlying DedicatedResources
            that the DeploymentResourcePool uses.
        encryption_spec (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.EncryptionSpec):
            Customer-managed encryption key spec for a
            DeploymentResourcePool. If set, this
            DeploymentResourcePool will be secured by this
            key. Endpoints and the DeploymentResourcePool
            they deploy in need to have the same
            EncryptionSpec.
        service_account (str):
            The service account that the DeploymentResourcePool's
            container(s) run as. Specify the email address of the
            service account. If this service account is not specified,
            the container(s) run as a service account that doesn't have
            access to the resource project.

            Users deploying the Models to this DeploymentResourcePool
            must have the ``iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`` permission on
            this service account.
        disable_container_logging (bool):
            If the DeploymentResourcePool is deployed with
            custom-trained Models or AutoML Tabular Models, the
            container(s) of the DeploymentResourcePool will send
            ``stderr`` and ``stdout`` streams to Cloud Logging by
            default. Please note that the logs incur cost, which are
            subject to `Cloud Logging
            pricing <https://cloud.google.com/logging/pricing>`__.

            User can disable container logging by setting this flag to
            true.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this
            DeploymentResourcePool was created.
