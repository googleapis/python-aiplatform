class Attribution(proto.Message):
    r"""Attribution that explains a particular prediction output.

    Attributes:
        baseline_output_value (float):
            Output only. Model predicted output if the input instance is
            constructed from the baselines of all the features defined
            in
            ``ExplanationMetadata.inputs``.
            The field name of the output is determined by the key in
            ``ExplanationMetadata.outputs``.

            If the Model predicted output is a tensor value (for
            example, an ndarray), this is the value in the output
            located by
            ``output_index``.

            If there are multiple baselines, their output values are
            averaged.
        instance_output_value (float):
            Output only. Model predicted output on the corresponding
            [explanation instance][ExplainRequest.instances]. The field
            name of the output is determined by the key in
            ``ExplanationMetadata.outputs``.

            If the Model predicted output is a tensor value (for
            example, an ndarray), this is the value in the output
            located by
            ``output_index``.
        feature_attributions (~.struct.Value):
            Output only. Attributions of each explained feature.
            Features are extracted from the [prediction
            instances][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.ExplainRequest.instances]
            according to [explanation input
            metadata][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.ExplanationMetadata.inputs].

            The value is a struct, whose keys are the name of the
            feature. The values are how much the feature in the
            ``instance``
            contributed to the predicted result.

            The format of the value is determined by the feature's input
            format:

            -  If the feature is a scalar value, the attribution value
               is a [floating
               number][google.protobuf.Value.number_value].

            -  If the feature is an array of scalar values, the
               attribution value is an
               ``array``.

            -  If the feature is a struct, the attribution value is a
               ``struct``. The keys in
               the attribution value struct are the same as the keys in
               the feature struct. The formats of the values in the
               attribution struct are determined by the formats of the
               values in the feature struct.

            The
            ``ExplanationMetadata.feature_attributions_schema_uri``
            field, pointed to by the
            ``ExplanationSpec``
            field of the
            ``Endpoint.deployed_models``
            object, points to the schema file that describes the
            features and their attribution values (if it is populated).
        output_index (Sequence[int]):
            Output only. The index that locates the explained prediction
            output.

            If the prediction output is a scalar value, output_index is
            not populated. If the prediction output is a tensor value
            (for example, an ndarray), the length of output_index is the
            same as the number of dimensions of the output. The i-th
            element in output_index is the element index of the i-th
            dimension of the output vector. Indexes start from 0.
        output_display_name (str):
            Output only. The display name of the output identified by
            ``output_index``,
            e.g. the predicted class name by a multi-classification
            Model.

            This field is only populated iff the Model predicts display
            names as a separate field along with the explained output.
            The predicted display name must has the same shape of the
            explained output, and can be located using output_index.
        approximation_error (float):
            Output only. Error of
            ``feature_attributions``
            caused by approximation used in the explanation method.
            Lower value means more precise attributions.

            For Sampled Shapley
            ``attribution``,
            increasing
            ``path_count``
            might reduce the error.
