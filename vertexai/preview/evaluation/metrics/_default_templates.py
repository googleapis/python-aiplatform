# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user input and an AI-generated response.
You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.
You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.


# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing coherence, which measures the ability to provide a coherent response based on the user prompt.

## Criteria
Coherence: A clear and coherent presentation of ideas. The writing should demonstrate a logical flow, where ideas progress smoothly with clear transitions, and maintain relevance to the main point. Effective organization is essential, with a clear structure, signaling, and topic sentences to guide the reader. Additionally, the writing should exhibit strong cohesion, using word choices, sentence structures, pronouns, and figurative language to reinforce connections between ideas and create a unified piece.

## Rating Rubric
5 (completely coherent): The writing has a seamless logical flow, is expertly organized, and maintains exceptional cohesion throughout.
4 (mostly coherent): The writing demonstrates strong logical flow, a clear structure, and demonstrates good cohesion.
3 (somewhat coherent): The writing's logical flow is mostly understandable, it has a recognizable structure, and cohesion is present but could be stronger.
2 (somewhat incoherent): The writing lacks a clear logical flow, organizational structure is weak, and cohesion is inconsistent or confusing.
1 (incoherent): The writing is highly illogical, lacks any clear organization, and has little to no cohesion.


## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Identify the purpose and audience: Understanding the writer's goal and intended audience helps determine appropriate coherence expectations.
STEP 2: Assess global flow: Analyze the overall structure and progression of ideas. Does the writing unfold logically, with a clear beginning, middle, and end?
STEP 3: Evaluate local coherence: Examine individual paragraphs and sentence transitions. Are transitions effective in guiding the reader through each point? Do sentences within paragraphs contribute to the main idea?
STEP 4: Analyze word choice and syntax: Look for repetitions, parallelisms, and other rhetorical devices that reinforce connections between ideas. Are they used effectively or confusingly?
STEP 5: Check pronoun and reference clarity: Ensure pronouns and other references are clear and unambiguous, avoiding confusion for the reader.

"""


INSTRUCTION_FOLLOWING_RUBRIC_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """# Instructions
Your task is to generate a rubric that can be used to evaluate the instruction following quality of responses generated by an AI model. You will be presented with a user prompt (<user_prompt>). Your specific task is to come up with a list of questions to test the instruction following quality. The questions should be based on the prompt that a user or a rater can ask about the response to verify whether the response fulfilled the requirement in the prompt.

Here are some of the rules of thumbs that you need to follow.

## Genre vs. Content:
Separate rubrics for *genre* (response format, e.g., tweet, email) and *content* (topic, details).

Example:
Prompt: "Funny tweet about a no-kids hotel." Genre rubric: "Is it a tweet?". Content rubric: "Is it funny?", "Is it about a no-kids hotel?".

## Informational Accuracy:
Rubrics must verify the accuracy of information in the response, especially for tasks involving transformations or external knowledge.

Example:
Prompt: "List 6 dog breeds." Rubric: "Does the response contain names of 6 dog breeds?".

## Resolvable Rubrics:
For prompts with verifiable answers in the prompt itself, rubrics should check for the *correct, specific* answer, not just task completion.

Example: Prompt: "How many 'r's in 'strawberry'?" Rubric: "Does the response state '3' as the number of 'r's?".

## Interrogative Construction:
Rubrics must be phrased as full Yes/No questions.

Example:
Prompt: "Sort converted values." Good rubric: "Does the response have all converted values arranged in a sorted list?". Bad rubric: "Response has all converted values arranged in a sorted list."

## Decontextualized Rubrics:
Rubrics should be self-contained and clear, without pronouns or assumptions of shared context between rubrics.

Example:
Prompt: "Convert Fahrenheit and kg." Good rubric: "Does the response have all decimal numbers converted as kilograms to grams?". Bad rubric: "Does it have the numbers converted [] to grams?".

## Prompt Wording Replication:
Use wording from the original prompt in the rubrics as much as possible to directly reflect the user's instructions and avoid introducing bias.

Example:
Prompt: "Code starts with first and last letters..." Good rubric: "Does the code for each name start with the first and last letters of the plant’s Latin name?".

## Polarity Maintenance:
Maintain the positive or negative phrasing of instructions from the prompt in the rubrics.

Example:
Prompt: "Do not include italics." Good rubric: "Does the response not include italics?".

## Granularity:
Break down complex prompts into multiple, granular rubrics that each check a distinct, independently verifiable constraint or phrase-level instruction.

Example:
Prompt: "Funny tweet marketing a no-kids hotel, pun, <100 words." Good rubrics: "Is it a tweet?", "Is it funny?", "Is it about a no-kids hotel?", "Does it use a pun?", "Is it under 100 words?".

IMPORTANT: Do not respond to the <user_prompt>. Only generate the rubric questions for the prompt.

# Output format. Write your final output in JSON according to this schema:

Every time you do this, increase the counter after "SxS Rationale" and output a new paragraph. Do not exceed five (5) iterations.

# Final SxS Verdict:

Finally, state your side-by-side (SxS) Rating on whether Response A was better or Response B was better based on your grades and rationale. Your rating should be one of {{A>B, B>A, A=B}}. Do not output anything else.

Example:
  [[SxS Rationale 0: Response B scored higher on the rubric. It correctly identified the type of cuisine and was more acceptable to a human customer.]]

  [[SxS Rationale 1: Response B scored higher on the rubric and human enjoyment ratings. It correctly identified the type of cuisine as Italian. The writing style was correct and professional enough and the correctness was more preferable.]]

  [[SxS Rationale 2: Response B scored higher on the rubric and human enjoyment ratings. It correctly identified the type of cuisine as Italian, where Response A mistook the cuisine to be Chinese. The writing style was correct and professional enough and the correctness was more preferable.]]

  [[SxS Rating: B > A]]

TEXT_QUALITY_RUBRIC_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """# Instructions
Your task is to generate a rubric that can be used to evaluate the text quality of responses generated by an AI model. Specifically, to generate rubrics for a user prompt (<user_prompt>) that describes the properties that should hold for a good response to that prompt. Generate the rubric following the provided guidelines.

# Rubric Generation Guidelines
## Verifying key aspects of 6 high-level criteria categories
Text Quality is evaluated with 6 high-level criteria categories as follows:
Response Style & Format Structure
Content Relevance & Conciseness
Content Completeness & Detail
Instruction Following
Groundness OR Truthfulness / Correctness
Harmlessness / Safety

The generated rubrics should be able to verify key aspects of all 6 high-level criteria categories.

## Rules of thumbs for good rubrics
* A rubric is a granular, binary constraint expressed in the form of a question, a decomposition, or a testable criteria. Think of it as a deterministic “yes/no” question based on the prompt that a user or a rater can ask about the response to verify whether the response fulfilled the requirement in the prompt.
* There are different types of constraints in the prompt. In this task, the constraints should be based on the 6 high-level criteria categories that we use to evaluate the Text Quality: Some are related to the Content Relevance & Conciseness of the response, some are related to Response Style & Format Structure, some are related to Instruction Following.
* The goal of this task is to appropriately capture all the different constraints that verify the key aspects of the high-level criteria category and associated with the specifics in the user prompt — such that given these rubrics, anyone could determine how well and completely the model fulfilled the constraints in the prompt.

## Additional constraints on the generated rubrics

* Generated rubrics should be ordered according to the “importance” of its high-level criteria category. The importance of the 6 high-level criteria categories is ordered as follows:

“Instruction Following” > “Groundness OR Truthfulness / Correctness” > “Harmlessness / Safety” > “Content Relevance & Conciseness” > “Response Style & Format Structure” > “Content Completeness & Detail”

For example, generated rubrics for “Instruction Following” should be output first.

* The number of generated rubrics for each criteria category may not be the same. We desire to include more questions for criteria categories of higher “importance”, e.g. “Instruction Following”, “Groundness OR Truthfulness / Correctness”.

* Not every rubric needs to be prompt-specific. Some can be prompt-agnostic. For example, rubrics for “Harmlessness / Safety” may mostly be prompt-agnostic.

* Aim for less than 10 rubrics per criteria category and less than 20 in total.

* Pay attention to the following, which are common mistakes of rubric generation:
  * Word count or length: If the user prompt asks for an exact word count or length, the rubric should be exact to the word count or length. Do not add "approximate" or "around" to the word count or length.
  * Reference content: If the user prompt contains a reference to a specific document or a specific context, the rubric should be specific to the reference content.
  * The rubric should be specific to the reference content in the user prompt: If the user prompt contains a reference to a specific document or a specific context, the rubric should be specific to the reference content.
  * The rubric should avoid hallucination: Do not generate rubrics that are not based on the user prompt.
  * The rubric should be logically correct: When the user prompt is a math word problem or a science problem or a data analysis problem, the rubrics should be logically correct.
  * The rubric should be concise: Do not generate repeated rubrics, including different rubrics that are semantically similar.

# Iteratively generate rubrics
Thoroughly examine the user prompt, generate rubrics for the given user prompt following the above Rubric Generation Guidelines. Review your answer, correct your mistakes and produce a revised answer. Do not exceed 3 iterations in total. Output your final answer for the generated rubrics.

# Output format.

Write your final output in JSON according to this schema:

```json
{{
 "questions": [
   "question 1 ...",
   "question 2 ...",
   "question 3 ...",
 ],
}}
```

IMPORTANT: Do not respond to the <user_prompt>. Only generate the rubric questions for the prompt.

Your task is to evaluate the text quality of the responses generated by two AI models. You will be presented with a user prompt, each model's response to that user prompt, and a series of questions against which the text quality of Response A and Response B will be judged.

For each response, provide an answer [[YES]] or [[NO]] to each question. Then, display the rubric score as the sum of the number of [[YES]] answers over the total number of questions.

For example, if the rubric questions are:
[[Rubric]]
<question>Is the response easy to understand?
<question>Is the response free of unnecessary words?
<question>Is the information in the response factually correct?
<question>Does the response cover all the necessary points?

Then you will score Response A as:
