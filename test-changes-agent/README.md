## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager (used for all dependency management in this project) - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) ([add packages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with `uv add <package>`)
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **make**: Build automation tool - [Install](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (pre-installed on most Unix-based systems)


## Quick Start

Install required packages and launch the local development environment:

```bash
make install && make playground
```

## Development

Edit your agent logic in `app/agent.py` and test with `make playground` - it auto-reloads on save.
See the [development guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/development-guide) for the full workflow.

## Deployment

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
make deploy
```

To add CI/CD and Terraform, run `uvx agent-starter-pack enhance`.
To set up your production infrastructure, run `uvx agent-starter-pack setup-cicd`.
See the [deployment guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/deployment) for details.

## Observability

Built-in telemetry exports to Cloud Trace, BigQuery, and Cloud Logging.
See the [observability guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/observability) for queries and dashboards.
